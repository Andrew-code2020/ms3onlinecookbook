# Holiday in Ireland

The Holiday in Ireland website is designed such that people at home in Ireland and abroad may search for four different types of holiday as indicated below;

1. Activity 
2. Culture
3. Wellness
4. City Breaks. 

The problem that we are trying to solve is that current holiday websites in Ireland offer too many different types of holiday. We want to slim down the offerings and focus
on the above named four strategically valuable markets. We have designed the website to offer bitesize information on the best quality holidays in these four areas. The success
of this website is that the user is able to locate the type of holiday they want quickly and easily without having to sift through the large amount of offers on other sites. 
Further success will be measured by the number of emails we receive asking the Holiday in Ireland team to make a holiday booking.   

### UX

The key reasons for producing the website were to;

- help potential visitors learn about Ireland as a holiday destination
- help new potential visitors learn easily about 4 specific types of holiday that are available in Ireland
- help new potential users connect and communicate easily with someone who will help them make a holiday booking in Ireland at a preferential rate.
- help new potential users easily follow Ireland on various Social Media accounts
- help Ireland attract tourists

At the outset the minimum viable product was determined to be a communication platform between the operator(s) of the Holiday in Ireland website and a source of basic information about holidays in Ireland at the best tourist destinations in the holiday type areas above.
It was an objective of this project to include an intuitive design which would allow new potential clients to navigate and enagage with the website without any prior experience of Ireland as a tourist destination. 
Current and potential client surveys were conducted to assess the minumim effective information required to illicit a positive emotional response from users.
This information was incredibly valuable during the construction of wireframes for the website. 
At the outset conventional web design features were favoured because we wanted everyone from the novice to the accompolished web user to feel like they were still in a familiar place on the web. 
The vision for the project was to have a website that displayed basic information on Irelands top tourist destinations with quick options to open a communication channel with the Holiday in Ireland team to help the user make a booking. 
Further objectives included;
- implementing interactive features on the web site to help the user feel in touch with Ireland
- allow the user to locate the holiday areas easily on a map of Ireland
- allow the user to learn some basic information about Ireland
- allow the user to reach out and make contact with the Holiday in Ireland team


###### User Story 1

I am a currently researching holiday destinations. A friend recommends that I check out a website named "Holiday in Ireland". I search the web find the Holiday in Ireland website. In particular I click on Learn about Ireland. I hover my mouse over the pictures on the page and card flip features reveal buttons 
that allow me to toggle through information on different pieces of content about Ireland and discover some basic information.

###### User Story 2

I want to book an activity holiday in Ireland. I browse the web and find the Holiday in Ireland website. I click on the contact us page fill out the form specifying the the parameters of my activity holiday and click Submit your Holiday in Ireland form.
I receive an email notification which has a copy of my form and the email address that the Holiday in Ireland use is also visible. 

###### User Story 3

I am researching culture holiday locations in Ireland. I log onto the Holiday in Ireland website and click explore Ireland. As I hover over the Violin flip card the google map markers that are relevant to culture appear. I know the where on the map of Ireland each culture holiday is located.

###### User Questions

- Where am I?
  - On each page the Navbar highlights that page in golden rod yellow. This helps you locate where you are on the Holiday in Ireland site

- How did I get here?
  - Clicking on certain icons opens up new Tabs so the user does not forget which website they accessed the content from such as Holiday in Ireland social media platforms. The platforms are currently connected to the developers account because the Holiday in Ireland social media accounts do not exist 
  - The navbar and footer are the exact same on each page and with the current page highlighted in golden rod yellow in the navbar so that the user may easily identify where they are and where they came from
  - The alert bar on the FAQ page has a COVID-19 alert providing users with the most to up to date travel information from the Government of Ireland. It opens into a new tab such that the user knows which website they came from

- What can I do here?

  - This occurs in the following places;
     - Navbar with the hover feature
     - Footer via the social media icons
     - The contact us page Submit your holiday in Ireland form button
     - The buttons under the flip cards toggle to reveal basic information 
     - The user can also click on the bottom left footer icons which directs the user to resources that helped make the website
     - The FAQ button contains a button to the left of the text which toggles to reveal more text content on the chosen subject area
  - The user may hover the cursor over the pictures on the Learn about Ireland and Explore Ireland page to reveal options which present themselves as buttons which then toggle to reveal further text content.
 -
- Where can I go from here?
  - The navbar and footer are the exact same on each page (except the FAQ page where an alert bar offers a link to further information on travel advice) and with the current page highlighted in golden rod yellow. In the navbar the user is able to easily identify where they are and where they can go from here. 
  - The blue hover feature is also designed to indicate to the user that they can click on this icon/button/word in the navbar and access further content.
  - On the home page the cards (under the main hero image) when you hover the cursor over the grid panels the panel will turn green indicating that you may click here to reveal content. When the content is revealed the current panel which the content refers to is in golden rod yellow to help the user easily identify where they are on the page and which destination the infomration they are looking at is referring back too.

#### Appearance differences on other devices

- On small mobile devices such as phones the navbar will collapse into a black cog wheel icon.
- The programming of the website allows it to adjust column widths on smaller devices and stack elements in a display to fit different browsers mentioned earlier and different devices mentioned earlier. The most obvious examples are the navbar which becomes a drop down menu and stacks on top of itself and the footer which stacks on top of itself and allows the user to scroll down. 
- The Project was built with mobile first design principles

#### Code Validation
I used the following code validators to help me debug my code

- Code Validators
 - HTML - https://validator.w3.org/
 - CSS Validator - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
 - JavaScript and JQuery valiadtor https://jshint.com/

I also used following website to help me correct any formatting anomalies in my code
- https://codebeautify.org/ 

#### Bugs

- Fixed Top overlaying my alert bar. During develpment I played around with a fixed top for the Navbar. At first the Alert Bar would disappear behind the Navbar. Then as I corrected the code the alert bar came in on top of the navbar but this would then overlay onto the section of each page. I used padding and height settings to solve this problem but I also used the sticky-top class in the navbar. I am unsure whether the sticky-top class changed things very much. I did a lot of refining with heights and padding to get the website to render the way it looks now.
- Fixed Bottom I deployed a fixed bottom for the footer early in the development process. Unfortunately this overlayed  in the section element of each page. I was unable to resolve this using height, padding and overflow css properties and values. Research and feedback would seem to indicate that fixed bottom is very hard to use appropriately. Perhaps future development will reveal a solution.
- On the learn about Ireland page when you hover the cursor over the card and then toggle any of the buttons you will notice that unless you toggle the same button to "close" the content before moving onto the next button will simple add it's content underneath. This is a bug that needs to be resolved in future development. 
- On the learn about Ireland page the history photo on the card flip had to be rotated to this photo because the other photos stretched and I could not resolve this stretch despite deploying css selector, properties and values to try and manipulate the other images.
- On the learn about Ireland page each image has inline style written into the HTML for height and width. Despite many attempts to bring the style into the css file each attempt led to either an image that was too big or didn't fit the container. This is definitely something I will examine in future development as I attempt to adopt the convention of styling within the css style sheet. 
- On the explore Ireland page you will find the code for the Google Maps API is written within the HTML file below the footer. I acknowledge that this is not recommended practise but I was unable to get the map to render unless the code was in the HTML page. I researched a reason why but I could not find one that I could understand and implement. I will need to keep looking for answers with this feature to better refine my coding skills.
- On the explore Ireland page you will find that the map does not fill the screen space or operate relative to the elements on the left to balance it's appearance. This is something I'm keen to find a solution too in the next stage of development.
- On the contact us pages the html code validator pointed out that the id = "gridRadios1" must be unique. I tried swapping the id gridRadios1 with gridRadios2 and adding the appropriate code in the sendEmail.js file but this did not lead to the correct information being transmitted through email JS onto my gmail account. Instead gridRadios1 was would render even if the gridRadio2 checkbox was selected. This is a code refinement I'll look to solve in future development. 
- My Mentor noted that my code formatting was not correct in some areas I preformed the Gitpod formatting procedure several times and nothing changed. I tried exporting the code to VS Code and formatting it there but then I couldn't send it back to the Github repository. I ran all the code through a code beautifier https://codebeautify.org/ and the difference was minimal. I don't understand what good formatting looks like because as I understand it seems to be unique to the company. I'll continue my research here.

            - Hover
            - overflow
            - card flip
- I used Bootstrap through out the project to deploy a mobile first design principle.
  - Website https://getbootstrap.com/
  - Features influenced
    - Header
    - Footer
    - Section
    - Navbar
    - Alert Bar
    - Form
    - Dropdown menu
    - Buttons

- Google Fonts I imported the text font Recursive from Google Fonts website https://fonts.google.com/

- I copied the hero image idea in a similar way to the Jumbtron idea from our code along whiskey drop project with the code institute. I used Boostrap to copy the code and then modified it to fit the style of this project. Reference to Github repository from code along project https://andrew-code2020.github.io/whiskeydrop/

- I copied the icons from Font awesome https://fontawesome.com/ and used the CDN to implement them in the project. I then wrote custom code to style the icons and make them more responsive. The icon next to the code institute is not the true code institute icon it is a freely available icon in font awesome. I put that icon because I felt it accurately described the code institute in an icon.

- I copied the card flip code from W3schools.com https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp. I then customised it's functionality in my project.

- I copied the toggle, show and hide, mouseenter, mouseleave code from jQuery https://jquery.com/. I reviewed the lessons on jQuery in the Interactive Front Development Module to help me implement the features in this project. 

- I copied the footer design from https://dermomurphy.github.io/Dublin-360-CI/index.html and then customised it to fit my project.

- I frequently referred back to the following code institute modules to research how to construct certain features

  - HTML Fundamentals
  - CSS Fundamentals
  - User Centric Front End Development
  - JavaScript Fundamentals
  - Interactive Front End Development

- I copied the knowledge of how to implement Bootstrap CDN and Font awesome CDN links from my previous milestone project. Link here https://andrew-code2020.github.io/CI-MS-1-Lean-Temple/

- I copied the idea of the class custom navbar from  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/. This did not make the final project cut but never the less helped me shape my understanding of the navbar from bootstrap. 

- I copied the majority of the content information available in the sections below from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland
  - History (Heading)
    - 19th Century (Button)
    - 20th Century (Button)
    - 21st Century (Button)

# Temple Lean Recipes

## Executive Summary 
The Temple Lean Recipe website is designed for people who are members of the Temple Lean Gym who are looking to eat the right type of food to back up there work in the Temple Lean gym

The recipe categories on offer are below ;

1. Breakfast 
2. Lunch 
3. Dinner
4. Snacks


The problem that we are trying to solve is that current Temple Lean members are trying to eat the right food and drink to back up their work in the gym but they get conflicting advice on when they do research online.
They also lack a social support network to encourage them to eat the best quality food. 
We set out to bring Temple Lean gym members into a community of their peers that contained the best advice on food and drink to help them get the most quality from of their gym membership at Temple Lean gym. 
The above named meal types are four strategically valuable markets. They are how people understand food at a glance. We have designed the website to offer bitesize information on the best quality recipes in these four categories. 
The success of this website is that the user is able to locate the type of recipe they want quickly and easily without having to sift through the large amount conflicting information on other sites. 

Further success will be measured by the number of Temple Lean members who sign up to the Temple Lean Recipes website.   

### UX

The key reasons for producing the website were to;

- help current gym members get the best quality recipe advice from their trusted Health professionals at Temple Lean Gym
- help members easily access 4 specific categories of recipe
- help integrate new and current members into a community where they
  - support each other on their nutritional journey
  - add recipes they have used themselves
- help 
- In the future help Temple Lean attract and retain online subscription members 

At the outset the minimum viable product was determined to be a community platform whereby the operator(s) of the Temple Lean and Temple Lean Recipe website add a source of basic information about healthy food recipes and social support in a health and fitness setting.
It was an objective of this project to include an intuitive design which would allow new and current clients to navigate and enagage with the website without any prior experience of Temple Lean the gym facility or even a high level of knowledge about healthy food recipes. 
Current and potential client surveys were conducted to assess the minumim effective information required to illicit a positive emotional response from users.
This information was incredibly valuable during the construction of wireframes for the website. 

At the outset conventional web design features were favoured because we wanted everyone from the novice to the accompolished web user to feel like they were still in a familiar place on the web. 
The vision for the project was to have a website that;

- create basic information that the user could read about healthy food recipes 
- Allow users to add recipes they feel have benefitted them for others to use
- Allow users to modify recipes they feel have benefitted them for others in case they discover new information about a recipe
- Allow users to delete recipes they created should they feel that they are no longer useful
- Offered a route to Temple Lean the fitness facility destinations with quick options to open a communication channel with the Holiday in Ireland team to help the user make a booking. 

Further objectives included;
- implementing interactive features on the web site to help the user feel in touch with Ireland
- allow the user to locate the holiday areas easily on a map of Ireland
- allow the user to learn some basic information about Ireland
- allow the user to reach out and make contact with the Holiday in Ireland team

- You may verify that the information is different on each card

- Go to the "Explore Ireland" page
- Verify that when you hover the cursor over the cards on the left hand side that cards turn over and reveal which location is matched to the google map markers visible on the map on right hand side
- You may verify the marker by clicking on the appropriate section of the map. By clicking on the map you will zoom in on the location you are looking for.

#### FAQ page

FAQ 

- Go to the "FAQ" page
- Verify that when you click on the toggle button on the left next to the text that more content appears.

- The contact us form is functional at this time and completed forms will be sent to burnsad@tcd.ie.
    - a photo is available of a test email sent from the form is available in the following directory assets/readmedocs/emailjs/emailjs.jpg
    - the {{from_email}} is set up in the cc of emailjs so the user gets a copy of the submitted form such that they know that the form has gone through to the Holiday in Ireland team. 
- The form is coded such that it will empty when the "Submit your Holiday in Ireland" button is pressed. 

#### Appearance differences on other devices

- On small mobile devices such as phones the navbar will collapse into a black cog wheel icon.
- The programming of the website allows it to adjust column widths on smaller devices and stack elements in a display to fit different browsers mentioned earlier and different devices mentioned earlier. The most obvious examples are the navbar which becomes a drop down menu and stacks on top of itself and the footer which stacks on top of itself and allows the user to scroll down. 
- The Project was built with mobile first design principles

#### Code Validation
I used the following code validators to help me debug my code

- Code Validators
 - HTML - https://validator.w3.org/
 - CSS Validator - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
 - JavaScript and JQuery valiadtor https://jshint.com/

I also used following website to help me correct any formatting anomalies in my code
- https://codebeautify.org/ 

#### Bugs

JS Tabs converted to materialize collapsible due to JS tabs rendering same information on each loop and because it cut down the amount of code we need.


Pictures 
-height in form that led to height styling versus height in recipes that need to be added to make pictures look uniform
-could find answer for this one

Delete profile (Not logging out)
-During the development of the delete functionality a bug was recognised whereby a profile could be deleted but the user was not logged out
-The user could then click the profile button and then get a jinja error message
-to eradicate this bug we input the pop method into the delete function and redirected the usier back to register page
-this solved the bug and kept the user away from unwanted error screens  


Breakfast page

-JS Tabs overflow on right handside light blue
-Tried div tab overflow hidden in custom css didn't work
-Tried container in French Toast
-solved with css display property

Profile page
-Email for profile directory @ symbol caused a root error

Gitpod 
-Code beautifer stopped working

Container class in materialise (Be careful !!!)
-If included in base html and code extended to other html then if class container present appears to wrap content twice and shrink size noticeably. Removed container from register html to solve this. 

Future Development
- reset your password function

- Fixed Top overlaying my alert bar. During develpment I played around with a fixed top for the Navbar. At first the Alert Bar would disappear behind the Navbar. Then as I corrected the code the alert bar came in on top of the navbar but this would then overlay onto the section of each page. I used padding and height settings to solve this problem but I also used the sticky-top class in the navbar. I am unsure whether the sticky-top class changed things very much. I did a lot of refining with heights and padding to get the website to render the way it looks now.
- Fixed Bottom I deployed a fixed bottom for the footer early in the development process. Unfortunately this overlayed  in the section element of each page. I was unable to resolve this using height, padding and overflow css properties and values. Research and feedback would seem to indicate that fixed bottom is very hard to use appropriately. Perhaps future development will reveal a solution.
- On the learn about Ireland page when you hover the cursor over the card and then toggle any of the buttons you will notice that unless you toggle the same button to "close" the content before moving onto the next button will simple add it's content underneath. This is a bug that needs to be resolved in future development. 
- On the learn about Ireland page the history photo on the card flip had to be rotated to this photo because the other photos stretched and I could not resolve this stretch despite deploying css selector, properties and values to try and manipulate the other images.
- On the learn about Ireland page each image has inline style written into the HTML for height and width. Despite many attempts to bring the style into the css file each attempt led to either an image that was too big or didn't fit the container. This is definitely something I will examine in future development as I attempt to adopt the convention of styling within the css style sheet. 
- On the explore Ireland page you will find the code for the Google Maps API is written within the HTML file below the footer. I acknowledge that this is not recommended practise but I was unable to get the map to render unless the code was in the HTML page. I researched a reason why but I could not find one that I could understand and implement. I will need to keep looking for answers with this feature to better refine my coding skills.
- On the explore Ireland page you will find that the map does not fill the screen space or operate relative to the elements on the left to balance it's appearance. This is something I'm keen to find a solution too in the next stage of development.
- On the contact us pages the html code validator pointed out that the id = "gridRadios1" must be unique. I tried swapping the id gridRadios1 with gridRadios2 and adding the appropriate code in the sendEmail.js file but this did not lead to the correct information being transmitted through email JS onto my gmail account. Instead gridRadios1 was would render even if the gridRadio2 checkbox was selected. This is a code refinement I'll look to solve in future development. 
- My Mentor noted that my code formatting was not correct in some areas I preformed the Gitpod formatting procedure several times and nothing changed. I tried exporting the code to VS Code and formatting it there but then I couldn't send it back to the Github repository. I ran all the code through a code beautifier https://codebeautify.org/ and the difference was minimal. I don't understand what good formatting looks like because as I understand it seems to be unique to the company. I'll continue my research here.

    - https://stackoverflow.com/
        - Features influenced
        - Background images
        - height and view port of map
    - https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp
         - Features influenced
            - Border
            - Hover
            - overflow
            - card flip
- I used Bootstrap through out the project to deploy a mobile first design principle.
  - Website https://getbootstrap.com/
  - Features influenced
    - Header
    - Footer
    - Section
    - Navbar
    - Alert Bar
    - Form
    - Dropdown menu
    - Buttons

- Google Fonts I imported the text font Recursive from Google Fonts website https://fonts.google.com/

- I copied the hero image idea in a similar way to the Jumbtron idea from our code along whiskey drop project with the code institute. I used Boostrap to copy the code and then modified it to fit the style of this project. Reference to Github repository from code along project https://andrew-code2020.github.io/whiskeydrop/

- I copied the icons from Font awesome https://fontawesome.com/ and used the CDN to implement them in the project. I then wrote custom code to style the icons and make them more responsive. The icon next to the code institute is not the true code institute icon it is a freely available icon in font awesome. I put that icon because I felt it accurately described the code institute in an icon.

- I copied the card flip code from W3schools.com https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp. I then customised it's functionality in my project.

- I copied the toggle, show and hide, mouseenter, mouseleave code from jQuery https://jquery.com/. I reviewed the lessons on jQuery in the Interactive Front Development Module to help me implement the features in this project. 

- I copied the footer design from https://dermomurphy.github.io/Dublin-360-CI/index.html and then customised it to fit my project.

- I frequently referred back to the following code institute modules to research how to construct certain features

  - HTML Fundamentals
  - CSS Fundamentals
  - User Centric Front End Development
  - JavaScript Fundamentals
  - Interactive Front End Development
  - Data Centric Development Milestone Project 

- I copied the knowledge of how to implement Bootstrap CDN and Font awesome CDN links from my previous milestone project. Link here https://andrew-code2020.github.io/CI-MS-1-Lean-Temple/

- I copied the idea of the class custom navbar from  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/. This did not make the final project cut but never the less helped me shape my understanding of the navbar from bootstrap. 

- I copied the majority of the content information available in the sections below from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland
  - History (Heading)
    - 19th Century (Button)
    - 20th Century (Button)
    - 21st Century (Button)
  - Geography (Heading)
    - Dimensions (Button)
    - Climate (Button)

    - Soccer (Button)
    - Rugby (Button)
  - Culture (Heading)
    - Music (Button)

-Information not found in the wikipedia page reflects my own experience of Irish culture or pieces of information that I have known for a long time from living and working in Ireland.

##### Content

- The content was constructed by the student with inspiration from their experience as an Irish citizen for the past 31 years. 
- The holiday destinations and the markers they hold on the map are real. The price to stay there is completely made up as are the activities.
- Holiday in Ireland is designed to be fictional and the business does not exist.

##### Acknowledgements

- I would also like thank the following members of the Tutor Assistance Team Tim Nelson, Anna (apologies that I could not find your surname), Xavier (apologies that I could not find your surname) and Haley (apologies that I could not find your surname). I spent many hours trying to work through problems I encountered with them.

                        On 1 January 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland and the
                        Kingdom of Great Britain were merged to create a United
                        Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The act of union removed the Irish parliament and
                        located all matters of governance to Westminister in
                        London England.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The UK seen Ireland as a source of Agricultural produce
                        and so Ireland largely missed the industrial revolution
                        of the 19th century.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Great Famine (1845 - 1851) saw Irelands population
                        of approximately 8.2 million people reduce by a third.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Great Famine along with a revival of Irish
                        Nationalism through organisations such as the Gaelic
                        Athletic Association saw a shift towards Irish
                        independence in the late 19th Century beginning under
                        Daniel O Connell progressing with Charles Stewart
                        Parnell but ultimately ending in diplomatic failure. The
                        20th Century would prove to be a new dawn for Ireland
                      </p>

                        1914 saw Ireland finally achieve "Home Rule" and achieve
                        limited autonomy from the United Kingdom. World War 1
                        led to the suspension of Home Rule for Ireland until the
                        cessation of hostilities
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Easter 1916 saw a group of Irish revolutionary leaders
                        known as the Irish Republican brotherhood led an armed
                        uprising against the rule of the United Kingdom. The
                        rebels seized control of strategic areas of Dublin
                        (Irelands capital). They were defeated swiftly by the
                        crown forces and the leaders of the uprising were
                        execeuted. Public support for the rising was low.
                        However the execeution of the revolutionary leaders did
                        not go down well with the public. Public support turned
                        in favor of the rebels when news broke that the
                        revolutionary leader James Connolly was shot in his
                        wheelchair
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Following the rising a young Cork man by the name of
                        Michael Collins redefined the strategy for achieving
                        Irelands liberty. Collins firmly believed that large
                        scale engagements such as the Easter rising would only
                        lead to further defeats. Collins preferred Guerilla
                        Warfare coupled with counter intelligence
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        From 1919 Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a
                        three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July
                        1921
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Collins led a delegation to London which ultimately
                        agreed to the partition of Ireland in the 26 county Free
                        State and the 6 counties of Northern Ireland

                        Ireland is located in the north-west of Europe, between
                        latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. It
                        is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the
                        North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres at its
                        narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic
                        Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies
                        between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a
                        total area of 84,421 km2 of which the Republic of
                        Ireland occupies 83 percent.

                        A ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the
                        centre of the island. The highest of these is
                        Carrauntoohil (Irish: Corrán Tuathail) in County Kerry,
                        which rises to 1,038 m above sea level. The most arable
                        land lies in the province of Leinster. Western areas can
                        be mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas.
                        River Shannon, the island's longest river at 386 km
                        long, rises in County Cavan in the north west and flows
                        through Limerick in the mid west.

                        The Irish climate is typically insular and is temperate
                        due to the influence of the prevailing southwestern
                        winds from the Atlantic, avoiding the extremes in

                        Irish traditional music and dance has seen a surge in
                        popularity and global coverage since the 1960s.

                        Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison
                        and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish
                        traditional music into contemporary rock music and,
                        during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between
                        traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many
                        individuals regularly crossing over between these styles
                        of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the
                        work of artists like Enya, The Saw Doctors, The Corrs,
                        Sinéad O'Connor, Clannad, The Cranberries and The Pogues

                        The Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance

                        Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was
                        the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of
                        years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age.
                        It began to be written down after Christianisation in
                        the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of
                        Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx
                        languages respectively.

                        English in Ireland was first introduced during the
                        Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and
                        merchants brought over from England, and was largely
                        replaced by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland.
                        It was introduced as the official language with the
                        Tudor and Cromwellian conquests.

                        Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made
                        innovations in the understanding of electricity,
                        dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of
                        matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter,
                        a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.
